        ],
        "explanation": "For most uses, distributing your application infrastructure between multiple AZs within a single region gives them sufficient fault tolerance. While AWS services do enjoy a significant economy of scale—bringing prices down—little of that is due to the structure of their regions. Lower latency and compliance are the biggest benefits from this list."

          "A"

          "B"
        ],
        "explanation": "Autoscaling is an important working element of application high availability, but it’s not what most directly drives it (that’s load balancing). The most effective and efficient way to get the job done is through parallel, load-balanced instances in multiple availability zones, not regions."

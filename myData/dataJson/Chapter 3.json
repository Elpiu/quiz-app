        "explanation": "The Basic plan won’t provide any personalized support. The Developer plan is cheaper, but there is limited access to support professionals. The Business plan does offer 24/7 email, chat, and phone access to an engineer, so until you actually deploy, this will make the most sense. At a $15,000 monthly minimum, the Enterprise plan won’t be cost effective."

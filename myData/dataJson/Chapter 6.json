The aws --version command displays the version of the AWS CLI installed, but running this command isn’t necessary to use the AWS CLI to manage your resources. Rebooting is also not necessary. Using your root user to manage your AWS resources is insecure, so there’s no need to generate a new access key ID for your root user."

        "explanation": "Security is about protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Granting each AWS user their own IAM username and password makes it possible to ensure the confidentiality of data. Enabling S3 versioning protects the integrity of data by maintaining a backup of an object. Deleting an empty S3 bucket doesn’t help with any of these. It’s not possible to create a security group rule that denies access to unused ports since security groups deny any traffic that’s not explicitly allowed."

        "explanation": "Preventing the accidental termination of an EC2 instance in the Auto Scaling group can avoid overburdening and causing performance issues on the remaining instance, especially during busy times. Using CloudFront can help improve performance for end users by caching the content in an edge location close to them. Doubling the number of instances might improve performance, but because performance is already acceptable, doing this would be inefficient. Monitoring for unauthorized access alone won’t improve performance or performance efficiency."

        "explanation": "Operational excellence is concerned with strengthening the other pillars of reliability, performance efficiency, security, cost optimization, and sustainability; automation is the key to achieving each of these. Improving bad processes and making people work longer hours run counter to achieving operational excellence. Adding more security personnel may be a good idea, but it isn’t a key component of operational excellence."

          "A"

        "explanation": "Application load balancer listeners use security groups to control inbound access, so you need to apply a security group that has an inbound rule allowing HTTP access. Applying the security group rule to the database instance won’t help, since users don’t connect directly to the database instance. You can’t apply a security group to a subnet, only a network access control list."

          "A"
        ],
        "explanation": "An application load balancer can use health checks to identify failed instances and remove them from load balancing. This can prevent a user from ever reaching a failed instance. A load balancer can’t replace a failed instance, but Auto Scaling can. An application load balancer distributes traffic to instances using a round-robin algorithm, not based on how busy those instances are. An application load balancer doesn’t cache content."

        ],
        "explanation": "A launch template tells Auto Scaling how to configure the instances it provisions. A dynamic scaling policy controls how Auto Scaling scales in and out based on CloudWatch metrics. There’s no such thing as a launch directive. Auto Scaling does not reference a CloudFormation template, but you can use a CloudFormation template to create a stack that contains a launch template."

        "explanation": "The maximum group size limits the number of instances in the group. Setting the group size (also known as the desired capacity) or minimum group size to 5 would increase the number of instances to 5 but would not stop Auto Scaling from subsequently adding more instances. Deleting the target tracking policy would not necessarily prevent the number of instances in the group from growing, as another process such as a scheduled scaling policy could add more instances to the group."
